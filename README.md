Heritage Tourism


   2.1**Heritage Classification**: For its exceptional fossil record and scientific importance to paleontology, Joggins Fossil Cliffs deserves to be recognized as a World Heritage Site. Its natural beauty and scientific significance led to its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008
   
**Issues**

   3.1 **Current Issues**: Problems of a physical and social/political nature plague the Joggins Fossil Cliffs. Erosion, weathering, and the effects of rising sea levels all physically threaten the site, which in turn threatens the preservation of the fossils. The indigenous Mi'kmaq people have a deep connection to the land, and there are political and social concerns about preserving the site from development.
    
3.2 **Conservation Plan**: Several measures have been taken by the Joggins Fossil Institute to fix the problems with the Joggins Fossil Cliffs. The cliffs can be protected from erosion by building retaining walls out of rocks, keeping an eye on the effects of rising seas and finding ways to mitigate them, and creating educational programs to spread the word. The Mi'kmaq people and the Institute work together to protect and preserve the Mi'kmaq cultural traditions at the site.

3.3 **Future Management Strategy**: Joggins Fossil Institute will monitor the environmental and societal/political threats to the Joggins Fossil Cliffs and take appropriate action in the future. The Institute may also consider rerouting streams or constructing barriers to protect the site from the consequences of rising sea levels. To further respect and incorporate the cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples into the management and interpretation of the site, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report's findings may also influence the site's management.

   4.1 **Interpretive Tools**: Guided tours, educational displays, and interactive exhibits are three types of interpretive tools used at Joggins Fossil Cliffs.
